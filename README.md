# GAME ENGINE

this is a game engine i built with friends for fun

it is my biggest project so far and a big stepping stone for me, i started working on it since 2021 when i only started to learn about computer science and 
most of my knowlege of programming, computer science and algorithms was learned and implemented for and during this project.

i whould like to thank mr WakaWaaa for the support on the physics engine stuff.

although its a hobby game engine and i know its missing a lot of important features for a game engine i whould love to get some constructive critisim for my next projects to come.

if you are interested in using this game engine you need to put in the folder dependencies/static-libs/ the follwing files:
* glew32s.lib  (x64 version) [https://www.glfw.org/download]
* glfw3.lib    (x64 version) [https://glew.sourceforge.net/]
* OpenAL32.lib (x64 version)  [https://openal.org/downloads/]
* sndfile.lib  (x64 version)  [https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/releases/tag/1.2.2]

and the following file to put in dependencies/shared-libs/
* sndfile.dll [https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/releases/tag/1.2.2]

i left some random project in the sandbox library for you to learn how to use the game engine
